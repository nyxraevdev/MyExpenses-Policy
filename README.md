🛡️ MyExpenses Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 2026
This Privacy Policy describes how MyExpenses, developed by Nyx Raev, handles your information.
1. Data Collection and Storage
•	Zero Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal or financial data on our servers.
•	Local Storage Only: All transaction records, budgets, and goals you enter are stored locally on your device's internal storage using secure encryption.
•	No Third-Party Sharing: Since we do not have access to your data, it is never sold, traded, or shared with any third party.
2. App Permissions
•	Storage Access: The app requires permission to write and read from your device's cache only when you choose to export your data as a PDF or CSV backup.
•	No Internet Required: The app functions entirely offline, ensuring your data remains within your control at all times.
3. User Responsibility
•	Data Loss: Because the data is stored locally, if you uninstall the app or clear its data without taking a backup, your records will be permanently lost. We recommend using the 'Excel Backup' feature regularly.
